A smarter way to find a hairstylist.


=======


**The problem**: Scheduling a haircut is kind of a pain, especially if you are looking for a new place to go. You can look on Google Maps or Yelp and deal with multiple booking systems, and even if the salon has a great repuation, you normally don't get the inside dirt on individual stylists. 

And when you do choose a place, you usually have to call them, during their open hours. You meet your new stylist, and he or she has to verbally ask you what you want. 

Then there is that awkward moment when you pay.

**The dream**: ZocDocs for hairdos. I find a great new stylist from my browser while pretending to work. I'd like to see ratings on individual stylists. I pay before I get there. The salon gets a photo of my best-ever hair day from Facebook or a picture of what I have in mind so they know exactly what I am looking for. I'd like to just enter my card details once, and get charged right off. I get a reminder email a day ahead. At the appointed time, I walk into the store, they recognize my face, sit me down, give me a nice haircut that I want, and I walk out. Maybe get a push notification or email prompting me to send a tip. 

Then the stylist can make notes on me such as:
 
* "He likes it shorter than most"
* "don't shave the back of his neck"
*  "he's a a guy who works in the internet business."
*  "He doesn't care about football, like, at all."

Whatever, really. This is for the salon side to see. Not the client!!! 

Then I can rate the individual stylist. And ideally if you want to go to the next guy, you can schedule in two clicks (or taps) *even at the last minute*.

I get a coupon on my birthday, too. Maybe a notice when my preferred barber moves or goes on vacation.
